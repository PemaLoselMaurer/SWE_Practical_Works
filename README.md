 ## Overview

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python, focusing on trees, lists, search techniques, sequences, sorting algorithms, and general algorithm design. The pratical provide clear and efficient code.

## Implementation

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python.
- Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes, where each node contains a value and references to its child nodes.
- Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types.
- Searching algorithms allow for efficient data retrieval from a data structure.
- Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specified order, typically in ascending or descending.
- Understanding the performance of data structures and algorithms is crucial for selecting the appropriate one based on the problem's requirements.
