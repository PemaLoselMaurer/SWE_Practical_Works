This project provides various functions to work with Fibonacci numbers. It includes recursive, iterative,
and memoized Fibonacci generation, checks for whether a number is a Fibonacci number, and calculates ratios between consecutive Fibonacci numbers to show their approach to the golden ratio.

FEATURES----
Fibonacci Number Generators

First Fibonacci Number Exceeding a Value: This function finds the first Fibonacci number that is greater than a specified value and returns its index in the sequence.

Checking if a Number is a Fibonacci Number: The project includes a utility to check if a given number is a Fibonacci number using a mathematical property of Fibonacci numbers.

Ratios of Consecutive Fibonacci Numbers: The project can calculate the ratios between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, showing how they approach the golden ratio as the numbers grow larger.

Performance Measurement: A helper function measures the time it takes for any of the Fibonacci generators to produce a result, allowing you to compare the performance of different methods.
