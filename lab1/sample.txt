Starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, “Notorious” is a 1946 spy film in which Grant’s American intelligence
agent recruits Bergman’s party girl to go undercover to root out some dangerous Nazi sympathizers right after
World War II. She’s the daughter of a German war criminal, so she has the right bona fides, and she soon attracts
the admiration of Grant’s target: a Nazi, played by Claude Rains, who’s involved in a nefarious plot. What happens
when Rains discovers where Bergman’s true loyalties lie, I’ll leave you to discover. But the dramatic tension is 
unbeatable, and the final shot of the film is truly chilling—a perfect “spooky” movie for the scaredy-cats among us
who don’t mind getting a little scared once a year!
